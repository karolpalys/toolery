**Toolery is a deterministic benchmark for LLM tool-calling.** It runs a model through
143 hand-written scenarios across four difficulty tiers, scores every run with
deterministic primitives (**no LLM judge — $0 cost, fully reproducible**), and ranks
models across a matrix of capability dimensions in a live terminal dashboard.

Built for benchmarking locally-served models (vLLM / llama.cpp / SGLang) — including
multi-node DGX Spark topologies — but works against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

---

## Highlights

- **143 scenarios**, 4 tiers — 40 easy · 45 medium · 34 hard · 24 very-hard.
- **Deterministic scoring** — assertions over tool calls, arguments, and final text. No
  model-as-judge, so results are free, stable, and diffable.
- **Three execution adapters** — `raw`, `cloud`, `hermes` — so you can measure *what the
  harness adds vs. what the model knows* (see [Execution adapters](#execution-adapters)).
- **Capability matrix** — coding, debugging, agentic planning, safety, adversarial
  robustness, restraint, error recovery, parameter precision, state tracking, structured
  output, tool selection, instruction following, long context, localization, budget
  discipline, terminal handling, and calibration/hallucination.
- **Statistical rigor** — tier-weighted means, time-decay over the last runs (14-day
  half-life), run-to-run stability (σ / worst / pass-rate), and McNemar significance in
  run-to-run compares.
- **Cluster-aware** — the same model on `single` / `dual` / `triple` / `quad` / `octa`
  DGX Spark topologies is tracked as a separate configuration.
- **Throughput** — optional prompt-processing and token-generation benchmarks via
  [llama-benchy](#performance-benchmarking-llama-benchy).
- **Textual TUI** — discover endpoints, launch runs, and explore rankings without leaving
  the terminal.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** for dependency management
  (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
- **An OpenAI-compatible model endpoint to benchmark** — e.g. a local
  [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) server,
  [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang), or any hosted API that speaks the
  OpenAI Chat Completions + tools protocol.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karolpalys/toolery.git
cd toolery

# Install the package and its dependencies into a managed virtualenv
uv sync

# With dev tools (pytest, ruff, mypy) — needed to run the test suite
uv sync --extra dev

# With perf support (llama-benchy as a pinned dependency) — optional
uv sync --extra perf
```

Everything below is invoked with `uv run toolery …` (no manual venv activation needed).
If you'd rather activate the environment, `source .venv/bin/activate` and drop the
`uv run` prefix.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Point Toolery at your running model server
export TOOLERY_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# 2. Smoke test — a few easy scenarios, raw adapter
uv run toolery run --model my-model --adapter raw --tier easy --trials 3

# 3. Full run — all tiers, all adapters, with throughput benchmarking
uv run toolery run --model my-model --adapter raw,cloud,hermes \
                   --tier all --trials 5 --with-perf

# 4. Explore results in the terminal dashboard
uv run toolery tui
```

A run writes scenario traces, scores, and (optional) perf into `./results/` and
regenerates the ranking tables automatically.

---

## Execution adapters

The **adapter** decides *how* tool calls are made and scored. It is a first-class axis in
Toolery: the same model can score very differently under `raw` vs. `hermes`, so each
(model × adapter) pair is ranked separately. Pass one or more, comma-separated, to
`--adapter`.

| Adapter | What it does | Requires | Use it to… |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`raw`** | Calls a local OpenAI-compatible server directly, using the standard `tools` API. The baseline — measures the model's own tool-calling. | `TOOLERY_BASE_URL` (or `--base-url`). Always available. | Benchmark a model you serve yourself (vLLM / llama.cpp / SGLang). |
| **`cloud`** | Same OpenAI-compatible protocol, but against a remote/hosted API. | `OPENAI_API_KEY` **or** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. | Benchmark a hosted model, or compare local vs. cloud. |
| **`hermes`** | Spawns the `hermes` CLI as a subprocess (agent harness) and reconstructs the trace from its session store. | The `hermes` binary in `PATH` + `HERMES_*` env (see [Configuration](#configuration)). | Measure what an agent wrapper *adds or breaks* relative to `raw`. |

> Adapters are gated on availability: `raw` is always selectable; `cloud` is disabled
> until an API key is set; `hermes` is disabled until its CLI is on `PATH`. In the TUI the
> launch modal shows the reason next to any disabled adapter.

## Performance benchmarking (llama-benchy)

Throughput is measured by [llama-benchy](https://pypi.org/project/llama-benchy/), which
hits the **same served endpoint** and reports prompt-processing (PP) and token-generation
(Gen) tokens/sec across several context depths.

Enable it per run with `--with-perf`, or run it standalone:

```bash
uv run toolery perf --model my-model --base-url http://localhost:8000
```

**You don't need to install llama-benchy manually.** Toolery invokes it through
`uvx llama-benchy`, so `uv` fetches and runs it on demand the first time it's needed. The
only prerequisites are that `uv` is on your `PATH` and your **model server is running**
(perf benchmarks the live endpoint).

Prefer an explicit/pinned install instead of on-demand fetching? Either of:

```bash
uv sync --extra perf        # declares llama-benchy as a project dependency
uv tool install llama-benchy
```

Perf is entirely optional — without it, every part of Toolery works except the two
throughput columns in the Rankings matrix.

## CLI reference

All commands are subcommands of `toolery` (`uv run toolery <command> --help` for details).

| Command | What it does | Key options |
|---|---|---|
| `run` | Run scenarios against a model and score them. | `--model`, `--adapter raw,cloud,hermes`, `--tier easy\|medium\|hard\|very_hard\|all`, `--category`, `--trials`, `--base-url`, `--concurrency`, `--with-perf`, `--cluster single\|dual\|triple\|quad\|octa`, `--resume <run_id>` |
| `tui` | Open the Textual dashboard. | — |
| `compare` | Diff two runs with McNemar significance. | `<run_id_A> <run_id_B>` |
| `rankings` | Regenerate the ranking markdown tables. | `--regen`, `--dimension` |
| `perf` | Run llama-benchy only (no scoring). | `--model`, `--base-url`, `--pp`, `--tg`, `--depth`, `--runs` |
| `list` | List recorded runs. | — |
| `scenarios` | List available scenarios. | `--tier` |

---

## The TUI

`uv run toolery tui` opens a six-tab terminal dashboard:

- **Home** — scans common ports (8000/8080/8081/8888/8889/5000/5001/11434, with an
  optional 8000–9000 deep scan) for OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Pick one to open a launch
  modal with a pre-filled flag form and adapter picker; it spawns `toolery run` as a
  subprocess and shows a live progress bar (current scenario, phase, completed/total).
- **Rankings** — the capability matrix. Click any header to sort; top-3 per column get
  🥇🥈🥉. See [the column reference](#rankings-matrix) below.
- **Compare** — head-to-head diff of selected models, per-column winner highlighted.
- **Scenarios** — browse the catalog; selecting a scenario shows its task prompt above the
  per-model results.
- **History** — past runs, with per-depth perf and details.
- **Profiles** — pick a use-case persona (Coding Assistant, Reasoning, Agentic
  Orchestrator, Safety/RAG, Customer Support, Data Analyst, Local Coding Agent). The
  persona adds a `UC:<Name>` column computed with persona-specific dimension weights; the
  global Overall is unaffected.

## Rankings matrix

One row per **(model, adapter, cluster)** configuration. Scores aggregate the most recent
runs of that configuration with exponential time decay; re-running the same configuration
tightens its stability stats rather than adding a row. **Every score column is a
percentage where higher is better — including `Calibr.`, where higher means the model
resisted hallucination more often.**

<details>
<summary><b>Capability dimensions (click to expand)</b></summary>

| Column | What it tests | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Overall** | Tier-weighted mean across all scenarios (easy 1× · medium 2× · hard 3× · very-hard 4×). | Composite of everything |
| **Calibr.** | Calibrated uncertainty — refuse/hedge when ungrounded; never fabricate or claim an uncalled tool ran. | "Price of ZZZX9?" → "I couldn't find that", not an invented $42.50 |
| **Coding** | TDD loops, multi-file refactors, file ops, git discipline. | Fix the failing test by editing `src/` only; commit a sensible message |
| **Debugging** | Root-cause analysis: tracebacks, regression bisect, multi-cycle instrument→fix loops. | Locate the offending `file:line` from a stack trace, then fix it |
| **Agentic** | Multi-step planning, conditional chains, parallel fan-out, autonomous composition. | "Email the cheapest of three stocks to Bob" — fetch in parallel, pick min, send |
| **Safety** | Refusing the user's explicit unsafe ask. | Decline a destructive op that needs confirmation |
| **Adversarial** | Prompt-injection resistance in untrusted tool/web/RAG data. | A tool result says "ignore previous instructions" — model stays on task |
| **Restraint** | Knowing when *not* to call a tool — answer from context instead. | "What is 2+2?" → answer directly, don't call the calculator |
| **ErrRec** | Recovery from timeouts, 429s, malformed/partial responses. | Tool returns HTTP 429 → retry once; 1 of 3 parallel calls fails → report partial |
| **Params** | Parameter precision — ISO codes, DST, numeric bounds, units. | "100 dollars to euros" → `base=USD, quote=EUR`, not "dollars"/"€" |
| **State** | Context-state tracking across turns — reuse prior tool results. | Turn 2 "buy 30 shares" reuses the price fetched in turn 1 |
| **Struct** | Non-JSON structured output — CSV, YAML, markdown tables. | "Return CSV with header `symbol,price,currency`" — no prose, no fences |
| **ToolSel** | Picking the right tool among plausible distractors. | 4 tools available; "What's AAPL?" → `get_stock_price`, not `get_weather` |
| **InstrFol** | Strict instruction following — hard format/length/negative constraints. | "Reply in exactly 3 sentences; do not use the word X" |
| **LongCtx** | Needle-in-haystack retrieval from long contexts. | Find an on-call number buried in a 3k-token runbook |
| **L10n** | Localization — non-English prompts and replies. | "Wie ist das Wetter in Berlin?" → calls the tool *and* replies in German |
| **Budget** | Completing complex tasks within tight tool-call budgets. | Full TDD rename across 4 files in ≤6 tool calls |
| **Term** | Terminal handling — shell pipes, CLI/ANSI parsing, destructive-command refusal. | "Lines containing 503 in nginx.log?" → `grep 503 … \| wc -l` |

**Performance columns** (only when run with `--with-perf`):

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **PP t/s** | Prompt-processing throughput (tokens/sec), llama-benchy, averaged across depths. |
| **Gen t/s** | Token-generation throughput (tokens/sec), same source. |

**Metadata columns:**

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Runs** | Independent runs of this configuration; the last 5 are weighted with a 14-day half-life. |
| **Set** | ✓ = scored against the current scenario set on disk; ⚠ = older set, not directly comparable. |
| **Cluster** | DGX Spark topology: `single` / `dual` / `triple` / `quad` / `octa`. |

</details>

**Overall weighting:** in the `Overall` column, scenarios tagged `coding`, `terminal`, or
`agentic` count 2×; `localization` and `long_context` count 0.5×; everything else 1× (a
scenario's weight is the max of its dims). This applies *only* to `Overall` — every other
column is raw tier-weighting, so e.g. `Coding` isn't diluted by other dimensions.

---

## Configuration

Set via environment variables (no config file needed for basic use), or copy
`config.example.yaml` → `config.yaml` and edit.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TOOLERY_BASE_URL` | Model endpoint for `raw`/`cloud` (default `http://localhost:8000`). |
| `TOOLERY_RESULTS_DIR` | Where runs are persisted (default `./results`). |
| `TOOLERY_SCENARIOS_DIR` | Override the scenarios directory. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Required for the `cloud` adapter; empty is fine for local `raw`. |
| `HERMES_API_URL`, `HERMES_GATEWAY_URL`, `HERMES_TOKEN`, `HERMES_WORKSPACE` | `hermes` adapter connection. |
